# Challenge Two Loan Application

The overarching goal I had for this project was to use the existing code that we created in class - and then add a real-world dialog/scenario to it to make it come to life.  This program runs a loan qualification process for potential home buyers and provides instant feedback to whether an individual qualifies for a loan, or not.  The program takes in information provided by the applicant and compares these credentials to current rates to see if there are any fits for a loan.  The user/applicant has the option to save their 'qualifying loans' as a new csv file so that they can have this information handy if they need it in the future.  And if they dont want to create a csv file of the loans, they can decline the option!
